## First Product
> "Our first product is a reputational analytics tool that takes existing comment log data to give indicative reputational scores to publishers.
That information can then be used by publishers to i) identify their best commenters so their contributions can be highlighted and become the basis for future journalism based on their own definition of “good”, ii) give moderators a sense of context about each commenter, and iii) help publishers understand the nature of commenter behavior on their site."
