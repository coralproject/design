## The Coral Project

On *The Coral Project*, we are creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism.

Throughout this project we will collect, support, and share practices, tools, techniques and studies to improve communities on the web.

This static site is still very much a work in progress as I add content and more structure to it over the next few weeks.
