# The Coral Project

On *The Coral Project*, we are creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism.

Throughout this process we will collect, support, and share practices, tools, techniques and studies to improve communities on the web.

This is the process  we employ across all design disciplines in order to properly assess user needs and frustrations so that we can properly ensure which products to build that will satisfy our user's goals and add a value proposition to everyone's experience.

## Introduction

The design process provides us with the appropriate techniques and tools to thoroughly assess the users' needs around a particular problem definition.  This is especially useful when we want to:

 1. make a decision based on observational or subjective data.
 2. gather behavioral and attitudinal insights from users.
 3. map intent to behavioral cues through user and mental models.
 4. facilitate design thinking and understanding across the company.
