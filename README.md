# Design

On **The Coral Project**, we are creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism.

Throughout this process we will collect, support, and share practices, tools, techniques and studies to improve communities on the web.

This is a break down of the design process  we employed across all design disciplines in order to properly assess user needs and frustrations so that we can properly ensure which products to build that will add a value proposition to everyone's experience.

## Introduction

> ### "People ignore design that ignores people."   *-- Frank Chimero*

The design process gives us the techniques and tools to thoroughly assess the user's needs around a particular problem definition.  It is especially useful when we want to:

 1. make a decision based on observational or subjective data.
 2. gather behavioral and attitudinal insights from users.
 3. map intent to behavioral cues through user and mental models.
 4. facilitate design thinking and understanding across the company.

##Design Process
This is our design process and some of the activities required in each. While they are in sequential order, there is a lot of circling back when we come across new findings  When reaching out to help contribute with design, please let me know which area you would like to be involved in. 

**Stakeholder Interviews**
Gather requirements, KPIâ€™s, and a wish list of features.

**User Research & Analysis**
Identify user needs, frustrations and behaviors through exploratory research and model them.

**Information Architecture** 
Define the navigation, taxonomy, terminology, metadata, findability and searchability.

**Interaction Design**
Create the interaction model, flows and prototypes.

**Content Strategy**
Content planning, development and management.

**Visual Design**
Define the brand, identity, color palette and type.

**Usability**
Cognitive evaluations around ease of use and learnability.

**User Testing**
Attitudinal and behavioral evaluations of hypotheses.


#### Project Success

Users distinct concerns are met with a personalized value proposition which is attractive and engaging. The platform is simple to understand and pleasing to use. The platform accurately meets the goals of the users.

#### Project Failure

Users have not had their needs properly identified nor met. The platform is unintuitive, cumbersome and adds complexity or frustration to their workflow.

#### Project Roadmap
Project roadmap for initial phase of project.
