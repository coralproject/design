<h1>Design</h1>

<p>On <em>The Coral Project</em>, we are creating open-source tools and resources for publishers of all sizes to build better communities around their journalism.</p>

<p>Throughout this process we will collect, support, and share practices, tools, techniques and studies to improve communities on the web.</p>

<p>This is the process  we employ across all design disciplines in order to properly assess user needs and frustrations so that we can properly ensure which products to build that will satisfy our user&#39;s goals and add a value proposition to everyone&#39;s experience. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote><p> &quot;People ignore design that ignores people.&quot;<br/> Frank Chimero    </p></blockquote>

<p>The design process provides us with the appropriate techniques and tools to thoroughly assess the users&#39; needs around a particular problem definition.  This is especially useful when we want to:</p>

<ol><li>make a decision based on observational or subjective data.</li><li>gather behavioral and attitudinal insights from users.</li><li>map intent to behavioral cues through user and mental models.</li><li>facilitate design thinking and understanding across the company.</li></ol>

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<p>This is our design process and some of the activities required in each. While they are in sequential order, there is a lot of iterating back when we come across new findings.  </p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong><br/>Gather requirements, research, KPI’s, and a wish list of features.  </p>

<p><strong>User Research &amp; Analysis</strong><br/>Identify user needs, frustrations and behaviors through exploratory research, and then model them.  </p>

<p><strong>Information Architecture</strong><br/>Define the navigation, taxonomy, terminology, metadata, findability, and searchability.  </p>

<p><strong>Interaction Design</strong> <br/>Create the interaction model, flows, and prototypes.  </p>

<p><strong>Content Strategy</strong> <br/>Content planning, development, and management.   </p>

<p><strong>Visual Design</strong><br/>Define the brand, identity, color palette, and type.  </p>

<p><strong>Usability</strong><br/>Planning and running cognitive evaluations around ease of use, and learnability.  </p>

<p><strong>User Testing</strong><br/>Attitudinal and behavioral evaluations of hypotheses.   </p>

<h2>User Research</h2>

<h4>Interviews</h4>

<p>Qualitative data gathered over the past year from exploratory conversations with more than 300 people in over 175 organizations from more than 25 countries.   </p>

<p>Task-focused follow-up interviews are currently being planned for our first product. </p>

<h4>Needs Analysis</h4>

<p>Needs analysis based on interviews from the exploratory research phase. <br/><a href="https://trello.com/b/Dhrb4D74/coral-s-needs-public">Trello board</a> with needs by role.  </p>

<h4>Feature brainstorm</h4>

<h4>Personas</h4>

<p>Personas are currently ongoing and will require a new set of interviews for validation and insight.  <br/><a href="personas.md">Personas project page</a>   </p>

<h6>Target roles</h6>

<ul><li>Audience</li><li>Engagement Editor</li><li>Journalist</li><li>Moderator</li><li>Publisher</li><li>Developer</li><li>Third-party Installer</li></ul>

<h4>Journey Map and Mental Models</h4>

<p>Journey Map is currently ongoing based on qualitative data from interviews.  </p>

<h6>Hypothesis driven design process flow</h6>

<ol><li>Conceptualize <em>idea</em>.</li><li>What <em>assumptions</em> can we make from this concept?</li><li>What <em>hypothesis</em> can we formulate from these assumptions?
<em>e.g.</em> <em>If</em> <strong>[action]</strong> <em>then</em> <strong>[outcome]</strong> <em>because</em> <strong>[user need/problem has been addressed]</strong>    </li><li>What <em>experiment</em> do we plan and conduct to test this hypothesis?</li><li>What did we <em>learn</em>?</li><li>What will do <em>next</em>?</li></ol>

<h2>First Product</h2>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Our first product is a reputational analytics tool that takes existing comment log data to give indicative reputational scores to publishers.
That information can then be used by publishers to i) identify their best commenters so their contributions can be highlighted and become the basis for future journalism based on their own definition of “good”, ii) give moderators a sense of context about each commenter, and iii) help publishers understand the nature of commenter behavior on their site.&quot; <br/>Greg Barber <a href="https://coralproject.net/first-product/">Our First Product</a>   </p></blockquote>

<h4>User Stories</h4>

<p>User stories are currently being developed based on needs analysis. <br/><a href="reputation-analytics-tool.md">Reputation analytics tool project page</a>   </p>

<h4>Wireframes</h4>

<p>Wireframes based on current needs analysis and user stories are currently being developed.   <br/><a href="reputation-analytics-tool.md">Reputation analytics tool project page</a>  </p>
