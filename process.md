## Design Process
This is our design process and some of the activities required in each. While they are in sequential order, there is a lot of iterating back when we come across new findings.  

**Stakeholder Interviews**  
Gather requirements, research, KPIâ€™s, and a wish list of features.  

**User Research & Analysis**  
Identify user needs, frustrations and behaviors through exploratory research, and then model them.  

**Information Architecture**  
Define the navigation, taxonomy, terminology, metadata, findability, and searchability.  

**Interaction Design**   
Create the interaction model, flows, and prototypes.  

**Content Strategy**   
Content planning, development, and management.   

**Visual Design**  
Define the brand, identity, color palette, and type.  

**Usability**  
Planning and running cognitive evaluations around ease of use, and learnability.  

**User Testing**  
Attitudinal and behavioral evaluations of hypotheses.

## User Research   
#### Interviews   
Qualitative data gathered over the past year from exploratory conversations with more than 300 people in over 175 organizations from more than 25 countries.   

Task-focused follow-up interviews are currently being planned for our first product. 

#### Needs Analysis  
Needs analysis based on interviews from the exploratory research phase.

###### Hypothesis driven design process flow  
1. Conceptualize *idea*.
2. What *assumptions* can we make from this concept?
3. What *hypothesis* can we formulate from these assumptions?
*e.g.* *If* **[action]** *then* **[outcome]** *because* **[user need/problem has been addressed]**    
4. What *experiment* do we plan and conduct to test this hypothesis?
5. What did we *learn*?
6. What will do *next*?
